# When2MeetHelper-1

## Description

This is an extension built for chrome that lets one view the available and unavailable people at a particular time slot in a when2meet link.

In the first iteration (version 1.0.0) this information shall be displayed in an alert box on hitting a keyboard shortcut specific to this extension.

## Motivation

Being a  head undergraduate TA at my university I have had to use when2meet quite often in order to schedule meetings. 

However, one cannot view the available and unavailable people for a particular time slot if the time ranges are very large since this information is limited to the top of the screen. In order to overcome this I would have to zoom out considerably which is not an efficient solution. 

Given that I am currently learning web development on my own I have decided to make a chrome extension that solves this issue. I plan to publish this on the chrome extension store as a free extension so that others can benefit as well.

## Current features

Extention in a usable state!!
As of now just displays the available people at a particular time slot
Also does the above if the cursor is not on a time slot displaying an empty list
